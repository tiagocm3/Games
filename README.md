# Games
Short mini-games I have made in Python for both enterntainment purposes and to learn the basics of game mechanics in Python

# Games
1) Hangman  `hangman.py`**
2) Snake `snake.py`**
3) Tic-Tac-Toe `tic-tac-toe.py`**

# Getting Started
You must have:
1) Python 3.8 or higher.
2) Pip (Python package installer).
3) Required Python libraries: pygame, tkinter, numpy (install using pip install -r requirements.txt)

# Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/melikeyigitt/Games-in-Python.git

# Running the Games
Running the Games
Navigate to the directory of the game you want to play and run it using Python. For example: cd [Game Directory] python [Game Script].py
